## My process

### What I learned

It truns out, in order to crop an image, as seen on the mobile version, you have to nest said image in a dedicated container. That way, it is possible to maintain the border radius.
I decided to keep the attribution section, just putting it in such a way that the user would need to scroll through the page to see it.

### Continued development

I still have to get more acquainted with the intricacies of CSS properties. Certain things don't exactly work the way I would have expected.
